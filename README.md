This repo has sample code that shows how to deploy a Python app on Acorn.

## How to use this repo

### Step 1 - Only UI

We'll first start by deploying only the UI. Navigate to `Step 1 - Only UI` folder and run `acorn run -n expense-app .` this will refer to the Acornfile and deploy the application only with the UI.

Note: To run it in developer mode `acorn dev -n expense-app .`. This will allow you to develop on the fly, meaning any changes that you do, Acorn will watch for it and redeploy the application.
